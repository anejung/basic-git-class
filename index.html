            The Snow Monkey, also known as Japanese Macaque (pronunciation: muh-KAAK) and Japanese monkey, 
            is a species of terrestrial (as opposed to many ‘arboreal’) Old World monkey. These red-faced monkeys 
            are found in parts of Japan in large numbers. They are considered as crop pests in some parts of their range. 
            A report from 2011 estimated that, in an average, they cause crop and infrastructure damages of more than $15.4 million each year.
